                            <p style={{lineHeight:"0%"}}>our complete meal shakes have no artificial flavors. we use a carbohydrate blend which includes allulose. allulose is a naturally occurring low-calorie carbohydrate that offers the taste and mouthfeel of sugar with 1/10th the calories and no added sugar. it does not raise blood glucose or insulin levels and actually moderates our insulin response to other carbs. Allulose is not a sugar alcohol and can naturally be found in figs, raisins, molasses and maple syrup and it can also be made through fermentation of several sources of carbohydrates. in addition, our shakes also contain sucralose which improves the taste of our products, without adding additional calories.</p>

If you are just getting started, try incorporating Soylent gradually into a balanced diet. as with any change in diet or health, we recommend talking to your health care provider or nutritionist to determine if Soylent is a good fit for your needs. Soylent can help you reach your nutrition goals over the course of a day or week. consider adding Soylent to your diet to ensure you are getting the nutrition you need to be healthy.</p>

GMO crops can provide nutritious, sustainable, and efficient yields that will help in maximizing the land in which they are grown. GMOs also cut down on food waste as well as the time and resources spent to grow food. this means GMO crops are more sustainable and reliable than those that are organically grown. many of the misconceptions and myths around GMOs stem from a lack of awareness around current science and our food system. read more about Soylent’s approach to modern food processing by visiting <a href='#'>our blog.</a></p>
